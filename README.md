## Installation and How to Use
You can download the latest release here on github.
[D2FilterPicker-1.0.0](https://github.com/mik1893/D2FilterPicker/releases/download/1.0.0/D2FilterPicker-1.0.0.zip) is the last avaialble version to download.

* Once downloaded, extract the zip file in a location of your choice and run the file **D2FilterPicker.exe**
* Browse to the default.filter in your PD2 installation folder (it might find it automatically if you have installed everything with default paths)
* The program will show your current filter on the right hand side, and you can select a filter from the dropdown list to view it
* Clicking Apply Filter will overwrite your current default.filter file and apply the selected filter. **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DEFAULT FILTER IF NEEDED!**
* Clicking Update Filters List will download the latest list of filters available. I am looking for volunteers to help me update the list, please contact me on reddit in case!
